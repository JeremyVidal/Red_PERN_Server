Welcome to your Budget Tracker

This app allows a User to track checking and savings data to help plan and to reconcile their bank accounts.

They can currently:

1) Signup and login to get to their personal dashboard.
2) Enter, Edit and Delete checking and savings transactions for their accounts.
3) Add custom Categories and Types for the user to track organize their data how they want.
4) Update their personal information.
5) Remove their account

(To come: adding income, charts for display throughout the site, a reports section)


The Admin role currently has the ability to remove a user from the system. And will soon have the ability to update a userâ€™s password or make a user an Admin as well.

A Guest has the option to sign up for the service or to just view the API documentation found on the main login/signup page.
